#FastStorage-Trace

This is a beginner-level data analysis project that uses feature selection, model tuning with XGBoost and cross-validation, and residual analysis to predict and analyze the behavior of virtual machine computing resources over the next 24 hours.


## Tools Used:
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control and documentation

## Project Overview:
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and tuning with cross-validation
- Residual analysis for performance 

## Project Files:
- fastStorage trace.ipynb：Main notebook with full analysis
- vmcpu_next24hr_pre.csv：The prediction results of virtual machine resource usage for the next 24 hours

## The dataset used in this project is sourced from [atlarge-research](https://atlarge-research.com/gwa-t-12/)
